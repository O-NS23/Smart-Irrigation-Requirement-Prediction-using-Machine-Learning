# 🌾 Smart Irrigation Requirement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project develops a **Smart Irrigation Decision Support System** that predicts the irrigation requirement levels (**Low, Medium, High**) using environmental, soil, and climatic parameters. Multiple Machine Learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate model for real-world agricultural use.

## 📌 Objective
To build a reliable ML-based system to help farmers and agricultural planners decide:   
✔️ Whether irrigation is required  
✔️ How much irrigation is needed  
✔️ Reduce water wastage and improve crop yield.
