# Smart-Irrigation-Requirement-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a 'Smart Irrigation Decision Support System' that predicts the irrigation requirement levels (**Low, Medium, High**) using environmental, soil, and climatic parameters. Multiple Machine Learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate model for real-world agricultural use.
